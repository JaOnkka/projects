CS442 - Computer Graphics at WSUV

In this class we developed a real-time 3D engine step-by-step using WebGL-OpenGL ES 3.0 and Javascript.
We have implemented a matrix and vertex libary for transformations, building meshes and textures through OBJ files, perspective and culling, a controllable camera, lighting, scene hierarchy, and terrain generation.
