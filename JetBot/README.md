CS483 JetBot Final Project Group 1

In this submission there is all code used in the project in the form of three Jupyter Notebooks, a zip file of
our dataset, our best model file trained off of our dataset, and two short videos showcasing the bot driving on the road
with and without signs.

Due to the file size here's a longer video of the bot driving on the road at first with no signs, then with signs added while it is driving.
