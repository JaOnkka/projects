CS483 - Topics in Computer Science - Machine Learning at WSUV

In this class we learned about machine learning concepts, algorithms, applications, machine learning models, and workflows.
We used real-world datasets to solve for classification, regression, and clustering problems.
We also learned about issues specific to real world data analysis such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and social and ethical issues.

We used Python and Scikit-Learn for all projects.
